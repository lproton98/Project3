      <h2>Quick Bio</h2>
      <p>I was born in Lansing, Michigan to German parents and spent most of my childhood between New Mexico in the USA and Nordrhein-Westfalen over the summers in Germany. My family (parents, one sister, and our cat) moved to Tennessee in 2011 where I graduated high school in 2016. I spent a year working at an elementary school through City Year in Philadelphia, and then came to the great city of Chicago to pursue my undergrad.</p>

      <h2>Personal Interest Highlight: Soccer/Association Football</h2>
      <p>Fun Fact: the best sports team in the world is Borussia Dortmund. I have supported them as far as I can remember being interested in soccer. Their ground is the largest in Germany, and has one of the best fan atmospheres in Europe, arguably the world. My cousin was born and raised in Dortmund, and his family is largely the reason I support Dortmund (BVB).</p>
