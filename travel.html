	  <p id="travelintro">I love to travel. I have grown up in many different places, and I don't like to stay in one place for too long. I have been lucky enough to visit over 20 different countries, most of them in Europe and North/Central America. Travelling puts me in an adventurous mood and allows me to experience something outside of the ordinary routine of daily life.</p>

      <h2>Additional Thoughts</h2>
         <p>Travel is fun, and it doesn't have to be expensive. You can stay the night in hostels, find cheap train tickets, and buy food at grocery stores instead of eating at a restaurant every night. Travel doesn't even have to be far away or exotic either (although when it is its certainly nothing to complain about). Sometimes exploring a city 10 miles down the road can be just as adventurous and surprising as flying halfway across the world. Additionally, as much as I have flown and will continue to fly, I do tend to think about the environmental impact of all my travels. Flight carbon offsets can be a decent way to compensate for the CO2 released through air travel, as well as opting for trains or buses where possible.</p>
